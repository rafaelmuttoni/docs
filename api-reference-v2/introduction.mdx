## Welcome

Welcome to Village's API V2 documentation. This is a preview version of our next-generation API with improved endpoints and additional features.

<Warning>
  This API version is in preview. Some endpoints may change before the stable release.
</Warning>

## Authentication

All API endpoints require an API key for authentication. To get your API key:

1. Log in to the Village Platform Admin

2. Navigate to API Keys

3. Create a new API key or copy your existing one

Include your API key in all requests using the following header:

```bash
secret-key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

For testing purposes, if your app is not live yet, you can use this test key:

```bash
secret-key: demo_sk_global
```

## User Identification

Most endpoints require a user identifier to specify which end-user's network we're referencing. This identifier should match the one you used when integrating the user with Village. Include it in the request headers:

```bash
user-identifier: YOUR_USER_IDENTIFIER
```

For testing purposes, if your app is not live yet, you can use this test identifier:

```bash
user-identifier: test_user_identifier
```

## Base URL

The V2 API is available at:
