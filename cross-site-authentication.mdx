## Authentication Flow Priority

When a user interacts with Village components, the system attempts authentication in this order:

### 1. Local Cookie Check
- If on `village.do` or any partner website, the `village.token` cookie is directly available
- No additional steps needed - authentication is immediate

### 2. Browser Extension Cookie Retrieval
- For embedded contexts, your custom extension using the Village Extension SDK provides cookie access
- The extension reads the `village.token` from the `village.do` domain and shares it securely
- Works seamlessly across any third-party website where Village components are embedded

## Technical Implementation

Your custom extension built with the [Village Extension SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@villagehq/extension-sdk) enables cross-site authentication by default starting from version **0.1.22**
