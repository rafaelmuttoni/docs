## Key challenges

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Ineffective spray-and-pray" defaultOpen={false} icon="face-frown">
    Reps rely heavily on cold calls and emails, resulting in low response rates and wasted time.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Missing out on low-hanging warm prospects" defaultOpen={false} icon="face-frown">
    Platforms don’t surface warm connections first, even on LinkedIn. This makes it hard to make the best out of a well-connected team or advisor or investor's network to close deals.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Lack of prospect prioritization" defaultOpen={false} icon="face-frown">
    Without trust-based prioritization, reps may focus on prospects who are less likely to convert.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cold emails sent to warm connections burns bridges with them" defaultOpen={false} icon="face-frown">
    Tools like Instantly, Apollo and Reply have made it easy to source and email 1,000s of people with some profile-based personalization. However, these tools are not able to identify people your team previously communicated resulting in tone-deaf communication with old meaningful relationships.
