## ATS platforms key challenges

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Low candidate engagement" defaultOpen={false} icon="face-frown">
    Recruiters and hiring managers struggle to identify candidates who are most likely to engage in the hiring process even if they sent an inbound application.

    Moreover, top talent for hard-to-fill roles might be poached quickly, so ensuring the highest response rates is critical.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="In-efficient job <> candidate matching" defaultOpen={false} icon="face-frown">
    Data on job vacancies and candidates is mostly static: job descriptions and resumes.

    Helping candidates find the right job is the difference that sets apart 10x team players from passive team members.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Slow hiring process" defaultOpen={false} icon="face-frown">
    Recruiters face long hiring timelines due to inefficient candidate discovery and a lack of trust in unverified applicants. Screening resumes, conducting multiple interviews, and assessing cultural fit can delay decisions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Bad hires" defaultOpen={false} icon="face-frown">
    Hiring the wrong candidate can result in lost productivity, poor team dynamics, and additional costs to rehire. Without tools to assess relationship-based insights or trustworthiness, recruiters often miss red flags during the hiring process.
