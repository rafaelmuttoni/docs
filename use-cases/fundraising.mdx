## Fundraising platforms key challenges

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Limited access to warm intros" defaultOpen={false} icon="face-frown">
    Founders often struggle to identify and connect with investors who are genuinely aligned with their vision. Cold outreach results in low response rates and wasted time.

  <Accordion title="Lack of prioritized investor directories" defaultOpen={false} icon="face-frown">
    Fundraising platforms provide investor directories, but they don’t indicate the warmth or relevance of connections, making it hard for founders to prioritize outreach.

  <Accordion title="Low engagement and retention" defaultOpen={false} icon="face-frown">
