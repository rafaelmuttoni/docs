<Steps>
  <Step title="Add button that triggers the paywall" titleSize="h3">
    This button would ideally be "Find intro" or something similar.
    When the user clicks it, it should trigger your paywall experience if they haven't upgraded yet.


  </Step>

  <Step title="Show Village &#x22;Find intro&#x22; once they upgrade" titleSize="h3">
    Embed the [Find intro](/embedded-uis/find-intro) button after users upgrade so Village can sync their network.

    <Info>
      A paid provisioned user is created when the user tries to connect their accounts for the first time, not when you identify them through your app.

  <Step title="Cancel a user's seat when they downgrade" titleSize="h3">
    If you offer Village relationship intelligence as an added benefit only to premium users on your product, then use this webhook to automatically cancel users who downgrade their subscription.

    ```bash
    curl --request POST \\
      --url '<https://api.village.do/v1/users/:YOUR_UNIQUE_USER_IDENTIFIER/cancel>' \\
      --header 'Accept: application/json' \\
      --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\
      --header 'X-Village-Secret-Key: VILLAGE_SECRET_KEY'
    ```
