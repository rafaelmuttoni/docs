## Welcome

Welcome to Village's API documentation. Our API enables partners to access connection paths and relationship data through their integrated applications. You can use these endpoints to add relationship intelligence features to your applications, such as showing connection paths to LinkedIn profiles.

## Authentication

All API endpoints require an API key for authentication. To get your API key:

1. Log in to the Village Platform Admin

2. Navigate to API Keys

3. Create a new API key or copy your existing one

Include your API key in all requests using the following header:

```bash
secret-key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

For testing purposes, if your app is not live yet, you can use this test key:

```bash
secret-key: demo_sk_global
```

## User Identification

Most endpoints require a user identifier to specify which end-user's network we're referencing. This identifier should match the one you used when integrating the user with Village. Include it in the request headers:

```bash
user-identifier: YOUR_USER_IDENTIFIER
```

For testing purposes, if your app is not live yet, you can use this test identifier:

```bash
user-identifier: test_user_identifier
```

For example, if you integrated user "123" from your system with Village, you would use "123" as the identifier in your API requests to reference that user's network.

## Core Concepts

* 🛣️ **Paths**: Connection routes showing how you can reach someone through your network

* 📊 **Score**: Numerical values indicating relationship strength

* 🤝 **Introducers**: People who can make direct introductions to your target

* 🚀 **Starters**: Your direct connections who can kick off the introduction chain

## Rate Limits

* 100 requests per second per API key

* Contact support to increase limits
