### Edit and preview

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Clone your docs locally">
    During the onboarding process, we created a repository on your Github with
    your docs content. You can find this repository on our
    [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). To clone the repository
    locally, follow these
    [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
    in your terminal.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Preview changes">
    Previewing helps you make sure your changes look as intended. We built a
    command line interface to render these changes locally. 1. Install the
    [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify) to preview the
    documentation changes locally with this command: `npm i -g mintlify`
    2\. Run the following command at the root of your documentation (where
    `mint.json` is): `mintlify dev`
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Deploy your changes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Install our Github app">
    Our Github app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you
    don't need to manage deployments yourself. You can find the link to install on
    your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). Once the bot has been
    successfully installed, there should be a check mark next to the commit hash
    of the repo.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="rocket" title="Push your changes">
    [Commit and push your changes to
    Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository#about-git-push)
    for your changes to update in your docs site. If you push and don't see that
    the Github app successfully deployed your changes, you can also manually
    update your docs through our [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Info>
  **Prerequisite**: Please install Node.js (version 19 or higher) before proceeding.
</Info>

Follow these steps to install and run Mintlify on your operating system:

**Step 1**: Install Mintlify:

<CodeGroup />

**Step 2**: Navigate to the docs directory (where the `mint.json` file is located) and execute the following command:

```bash
mintlify dev
```

A local preview of your documentation will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Custom Ports

By default, Mintlify uses port 3000. You can customize the port Mintlify runs on by using the `--port` flag. To run Mintlify on port 3333, for instance, use this command:

```bash
mintlify dev --port 3333
```

If you attempt to run Mintlify on a port that's already in use, it will use the next available port:

```md
Port 3000 is already in use. Trying 3001 instead.
```

## Mintlify Versions

Please note that each CLI release is associated with a specific version of Mintlify. If your local website doesn't align with the production version, please update the CLI:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm
  npm i -g mintlify@latest
  ```

  ```bash yarn
  yarn global upgrade mintlify
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Validating Links

The CLI can assist with validating reference links made in your documentation. To identify any broken links, use the following command:

```bash
mintlify broken-links
```

## Deployment

<Tip>
  Unlimited editors available under the [Pro
  Plan](https://mintlify.com/pricing) and above.
</Tip>

If the deployment is successful, you should see the following:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/checks-passed.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
</Frame>

## Code Formatting

We suggest using extensions on your IDE to recognize and format MDX. If you're a VSCode user, consider the [MDX VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx) for syntax highlighting, and [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) for code formatting.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Error: Could not load the &#x22;sharp&#x22; module using the darwin-arm64 runtime">
    This may be due to an outdated version of node. Try the following:

    1. Remove the currently-installed version of mintlify: `npm remove -g mintlify`

    2. Upgrade to Node v19 or higher.

    3. Reinstall mintlify: `npm install -g mintlify`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Issue: Encountering an unknown error">
    Solution: Go to the root of your device and delete the \~/.mintlify folder. Afterwards, run `mintlify dev` again.
