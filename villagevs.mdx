### Here's a detailed comparison of how Village outperforms building in-house:&#x20;

| **Criteria**                 | **Village API** 🏆           | **In-House** 🛠️ | **Details**                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <br /><br />**Speed**        |                              |                  |                                                                                                                        |
| Build & GTM speed            | ✅ 1 week                     | ❌ 18 months      | Save time with pre-built API components for most use-cases.                                                            |
| <br />**Costs**              |                              |                  |                                                                                                                        |
| Build cost                   | ✅ $5/user/month              | ❌ $1.5M+         | You only need a part-time engineer vs a full team of 8 engineers, PM and designers.                                    |
| Maintainenance & reliability | ✅ Included                   | ❌ Distracting    | Guaranteed reliability and zero ongoing burden to keep services active                                                 |
| Data acquisition & cleaning  | ✅ Included                   | ❌ Expensive      | Save $200k+ per year acquiring, cleaning and mapping public data relationships                                         |
| Server                       | ✅ Included                   | ❌ $2k+/month     | Village eliminates the need for dedicated server expenses for graph operations                                         |
| <br />**Impact**             |                              |                  |                                                                                                                        |
| Relationship intelligence    | ✅ 10+ data sources           | ❌ 3 (at best)    | Village integrates across 10+ sources vs. limited in-house capabilities.                                               |
| User friction                | ✅ Minimal                    | ❌ High           | Pull, analyze then utilize user's private and public data in seconds                                                   |
| Village network              | ✅ 30+ partners, largest grid | ❌ None           | Larger pool of connected accounts, means better identity matching and wider reach through other Village network users. |
| <br />**Strategic**          |                              |                  |                                                                                                                        |
| Competitive advantage        | ✅  10x faster                | ✅ Yes            | Both provide an edge, but Village achieves it faster and at scale.                                                     |
| Network moat                 | ✅ Enterprise only            | ✅ Yes            | Opt-out from the global network grid and host your own private graph                                                   |
| <br /><br />**Overall ROI**  | ✅ High                       | ❌  Low           | Village offers fast time-to-value at a lower entry barrier, helping you save costs and achieve highest impact.         |

## Why Village API Stands Out

* **Seamless Integration**: Ready-to-use network graph in just 1 week.

* **Largest Relationship Grid**: Gain access to a 30+ partner reverse lookup network.

* **Cost-Effective Scalability**: Avoid the $1.5M+ engineering expense of in-house development.
