## Overview

The `Village.logout()` function allows you to programmatically end the user's current session with Village directly from your application. This is useful when a user logs out of your main application and you want to ensure their Village session is cleared as well.

## Usage

Simply call the logout function directly with `Village`:

```javascript
// Example: Call Village logout when the user logs out of your application
function handleYourAppLogout() {
  // Your application's logout logic...

  // Village Logout
  Village.logout()
}
```

This ensures that the user's connection data is no longer active within the widget on your site after they log out.
