<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Extension SDK" titleSize="h2">
    ```markup
    npm install @villagehq/extension-sdk
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add to your Extension" titleSize="h2">
    The SDK provides two main functions:

    ```javascript
    import Village from "@villagehq/extension-sdk";
    
    // Initialize Village service worker
    Village.initServiceWorker();
    ```

    ```javascript
    import Village from "@villagehq/extension-sdk";
    
    // Initialize Village content script
    Village.initContentScript();
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Required permissions" titleSize="h2">
    Your extension's manifest.json must include the following permissions:

    ```javascript
        "permissions": [
          "cookies",
          "storage",
          "webRequest",
          "alarms",
          "webNavigation"
        ],
        "host_permissions": ["*://*.linkedin.com/*", "*://*.village.do/*"],
        "externally_connectable": {
          "matches": ["*://*.village.do/*"]
        }
        
      
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test your extension">
    Go to the [Platform Admin](https://village.do/platform/settings/features) and add your Extension's ID to verify your integration:

## Cross-Site Authentication

Extensions built with the Village Extension SDK enable seamless authentication across different domains and embedded contexts. This allows users to stay logged in when accessing Village components on third-party websites like job boards or partner platforms.

Learn more about how this works in our detailed [Cross-Site Authentication](/cross-site-authentication) guide.

  <Accordion title="My extension integration is not working" defaultOpen="true">
    If in the Platform Admin you weren't able to verify the communication with your extension, you can go to the console of your extension's service worker and use both `villageExtension.getLogs()` and `villageExtension.enableDebug()` to debug your integration. If you're still facing problems, please contact support at [support@village.do](mailto:support@village.do)
